## About ##

iHopla will allow you to keep track of your performance after completing Dave Hoplaâ€™s designed shooting workouts. Choose your court size: Professional, College, High School/Junior High, or International. iHopla allows you to record how many shot attempts you take to knock down ten makes from each spot on the court. You log this information through a variety of different drill sets, encompassing different aspects of the game, and utilizing the entire basketball court and skill set. The logged workouts and results are all saved and stored on your Apple device.

Dave Hopla is considered by many to be the top shooter in the world. He regularly knocks down 495 out of 500 shots. Dave regularly keeps track of all his shots when he practices and lectures and now you can too!
