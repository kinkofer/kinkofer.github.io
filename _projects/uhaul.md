## About U-Haul ##

"U-Haul serves more than 11 million do-it-yourself household moving customers annually. Our primary service objective is to provide a better and better product and service to more and more people a lower and lower cost."

U-Haul's mobile team was started around 2013, developing a small web wrapper app for the U-Haul site and experimenting with enterprise apps. In the following years, the number of enterprise apps grew, while a new team was later hired to create a more native U-Haul app, which was released in 2017 for iOS and Android. The team consists of a manager and two leads, one for consumer apps and one for enterprise apps. Android, iOS, and Web developers collaborate and work between both consumer and enterprise.

## About Enterprise Apps ##

The largest enterprise app effort supports over 800 field managers across the US and Canada. Provided with iPads, they've used up to six apps to fill various work requirements. The Logbook app is used for time and driver tracking, which produces logs that must meet federal and state/province requirements in both countries. A Mapping app shows nearby U-Haul locations and helps the field managers recruit local businesses as U-Haul truck renters, known as dealers. A few apps also help with the recruitment process, some help manage new dealers, and others are utility apps for documents and contacts.
