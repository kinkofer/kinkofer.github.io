## About ##

The University of Advancing of Technology joined the Blizzard University Relations Program to create a series of tutorials and art assets for their expansive StarCraft mod community. The ability to add custom models to the mod tools were unreleased at the time of the collaboration. As Blizzard prepared to release the StarTools that allowed custom models, students at UAT were given the opportunity to participate in the beta version and create a tutorial while receiving feedback from Blizzard developers.

## Work ##

* Managed the art team who created assets from concept to modeling, through animation
* Recorded presentations at each milestone to update Blizzard on the progress of assets
* Consulted over teleconference with a Blizzard Producer and Artists to get feedback on models
* Added assets into the StarCraft II Mod Tools and created a tutorial
