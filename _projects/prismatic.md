## About Prismatic ##
Prismatic Games was founded by software developer Chris Jennewein and the artist of the award winning game The Bridge, Mario Castaneda. After receiving their degrees in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University, the duo continued their education at the University of Advancing Technology where Chris explored game production and management and Mario expanded his art skills to 3D modeling. Their first game as Prismatic is the Wii U party/RTS, Hex Heroes. 

Prismatic’s mission – innovate and illuminate.
