## About ##

Swift Pokémon API is a framework for accessing Pokemon data. Forked from a project that used third-party frameworks, the framework was rewritten without dependencies and updated for the latest Swift version. It's a Swift wrapper for [PokéApi.co](http://pokeapi.co), which accesses the Pokemon data used for [veekun](https://github.com/veekun/), a PokéDex website. It's available for all Apple platforms, and can be downloaded through Cocoapods or Carthage.
