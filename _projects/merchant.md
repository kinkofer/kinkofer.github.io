## About ##

Merchant is a tycoon style game based in a fantasy RPG. Instead of controlling the hero of the story, you control the merchant that the hero buys and sells goods from. You will be responsible for helping the heroes by selling them things they need, while buying all of the items they do not want. The heroes are persistent characters in game, so they will return to you if you keep them happy.
