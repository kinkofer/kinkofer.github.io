## About ##

Sideways (formerly iNomadics) was founded by successful internet entrepreneur, Charles Stack, as a mobile multimedia publisher. During the summer of 2010, Sideways provided an internship opportunity for 7 students to create an iPad game. Using the SIO2 engine and Blender modeling software, the team completed a game in 3 months. Although the game was completed, the small scope of the project never saw it published on the App Store.
