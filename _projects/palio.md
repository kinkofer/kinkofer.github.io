## About ##

The Palio Project is a game intended to capture the full intensity and majesty of the Palio, a horse race in Siena, Italy. The player does not play as the jockey, but as the horse, as horses can win the Palio without a jockey.  This ninety second race requires luck, skill, focus, and determination from the player and rewards the winner with great glory.
