## About ##

"Parking Dude's mission is to educate, inform, and offer unique services to residents and visitors to help them own, operate, and park a car in the city of Hoboken, NJ."

Parking Dude was an app created to solve the parking demand in Hoboken, New Jersey. Starting off as an app that allowed users to designate their parking location and warn of street cleaning, it has grown to provide services such as valet, snow shoveling, and car washes. It's currently available for iOS and Android.

The original app was written in Objective-C with a MAMP backend stack. It's been updated to Swift and now uses Laravel with MySQL for both its web services and website.
