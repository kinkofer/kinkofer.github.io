## About ##

The Qube Lab was created by an instructor from Case Western Reserve University and employed several students from the Case community, including graphic designers from the Cleveland Institute of Art. The function of The Qube Lab was to provide application development services to local Cleveland businesses. Students had the opportunities to select projects based on skills they wanted to learn or improve.
