## About ##

ChromaWaves is a game that allows players to use the multi-touch functionality of the iPhone & iPod Touch to select and even mix colors. From a centralized water droplet, the player can drag and flick their finger through a ring of pigment to thwart off enemies, based on the selected color. ChromaWaves also features several different “ink-blot” inspired enemies, Chromites, that gradually make their way to the player, vary in behavior and take on any of the colors the player can choose from.

ChromaWaves was produced between the Cleveland Institute of Art (CIA) and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), with student developers forming as iGameTeam. Development of the game took place over the Game Production course in the Fall 2009 semester, with postproduction carrying over into the early Spring. ChromaWaves went through several weeks of prototyping the gameplay, visual preproduction, and received rigorous playtesting between its creators, college students and professors, friends, family, and even younger children for feedback and observation.
